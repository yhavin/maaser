# Ma'aser tracking

An easy-to-use application for Jewish people to track how much ma'aser they owe.

[Live application](https://ma-aser.web.app)

## Background
Jewish people are obligated to donate to charity 10% of their income (Deuteronomy 14:22). The 10% portion is called "ma'aser" in Hebrew. This application solves the problem of keeping track of how much ma'aser one has given and how much one owes. 

Optionally, one can donate more than 10%, so there is the ability to choose what percentage the user wants to donate for each income they enter (with 10% default).

## Features
1. Create an account and log in
2. Enter income and donations as they occur
3. View the ma'aser owing calculation
4. Income and ma'aser are saved in the user's account
5. Export income and donations to CSV
