# Ma'aser Money

Ma'aser Money is used by hundreds of people in the Jewish and Christian communities to track how much ma'aser / tithe donations they owe.

## Live application
[Ma'aser Money](https://maaser.money)

## Background
There is a biblical obligation to donate 10% of one's income to charity ([Deuteronomy 14:22](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.14.22?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en)). The 10% portion is called "ma'aser" in Hebrew, which translates to "tithe". Ma'aser Money solves the problem of keeping track of how much ma'aser you have given and how much you owe.

## Usage
- Create an account and log in
- Enter income and donations as they occur
- Create recurring income schedules (e.g., for salaries)
- Add deductions for things like business expenses, or taxes if you are self-employed
- View the amount of ma'aser / tithe owing
- Tag donations as tax deductible
- View all transactions and search by description or amount
- Export transactions to CSV for further analysis if desired
