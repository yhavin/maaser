# Ma'aser tracking

An easy-to-use application for Jewish people to track how much ma'aser they owe.

## Background
Jewish people are obligated to donate to charity 10% of their income (Deuteronomy 14:22). The 10% portion is called "ma'aser" in Hebrew. This application solves the problem of keeping track of how much ma'aser one has given and how much one owes. Optionally, one can donate more than 10%, and this application gives the ability to choose what percentage the user wants to donate for each income they enter (with 10% default).

## Instructions
1. Create an account and log in
2. Enter incomes
3. Enter ma'aser / donations
4. View the ma'aser calculation on the screen
5. Income and ma'aser are saved in the user's account
